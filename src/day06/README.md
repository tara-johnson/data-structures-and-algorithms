# Linked List Insertions

## Challenge
Write the following methods for the Linked List class:

* .append(value) which adds a new node with a given value to the end of the list

* .insertBefore(value, newVal) which adds a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node

* .insertAfter(value, newVal) which adds a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node

Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

Example:

.append(value)
Input\
```
head -> [1] -> [3] -> [2] -> x
```
Output\

```
Output\
