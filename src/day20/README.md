#Flip a Binary Tree
Flip a Binary Tree so it's left and right nodes are swapped

## Challenge
Create a method that traverses through a binary tree and swaps each right and left value.

Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

Example:

Input  
```
    8
  /   \
 2     6
      /
     7
     \
      1
```

Output
```
    8
  /   \
 6     2
  \
   7
  /
 1
```
