#Find a stack's maximum value

## Challenge
Create a method that returns the highest value stored in a stack. The method should work even when the stack has been
updated (ie. an item has been pushed or popped from the stack and the max value may have changed).

Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

Example:

Input
```
2, 6, 5, 4, 7, 3 (assume 3 was the last in)
```
Output
```
returns 7
```
