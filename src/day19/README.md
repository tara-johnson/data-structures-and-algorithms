#Find the Maximum Value in a Binary Tree

## Challenge
Write a function which takes a Binary Tree as its only input. Return the maximum value stored in the tree. You can assume that the values stored in the Binary Tree will be numeric.

Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

Example:

Input
```
               2
          /        \
         7          5
      /    \         \
     2      6         9
          /    \     /
         5     11   4
