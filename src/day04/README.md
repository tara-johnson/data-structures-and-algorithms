# Array Adjacent Product
Largest product of 2 adjacent values in a 2D array

## Challenge
Write a function called largestProduct which takes in a 2D array, of arbitrary size. Return the largest product of 2 adjacent values within the 2D array. Adjacent values might be horizontally, vertically, or diagonally connected.

Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

Example:
Input
[
    [1, 2, 1]
    [2, 4, 2]
