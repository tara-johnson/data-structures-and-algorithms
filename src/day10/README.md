#Reverse a Linked List

## Challenge
Write a method for the Linked List class which reverses the order of the list. Return the modified list. Your implementation must not use any additional memory or modify the nodes of the linked list.

Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

Example:

Input:  
```head -> [1] -> [2] -> [3] -> x```

Output:  
```head -> [3] -> [2] -> [1] -> x```
