#First-in, First-out Animal Shelter

## Challenge
Create a class called Animal Shelter which holds only dogs and cats. The shelter operates using a first-in, first-out
approach.
Implement the following methods:
- engueue(animal): adds animal to the shelter. animal can be either a dog or a cat object.
- dequeue(pref): returns either a dog or a cat. If pref (a string) is 'cat', return the longest-waiting cat. If pref is
a 'dog', return the longest-waiting dog. For anything else, return either a cat or a dog.

Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.
