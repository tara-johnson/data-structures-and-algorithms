# Rotate an Array
Rotate a 3x3 matrix (an array of integers), by 90 degrees clockwise.

## Challenge
Write a function to rotate a 3x3 matrix (an array of integers), by 90 degrees clockwise. Return the rotated array.

Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

Example:

Input
```
[
    [1, 1, 1]
    [2, 2, 2]
    [3, 3, 3]
]
```
Output
```
[
    [3, 2, 1]
    [3, 2, 1]
    [3, 2, 1]
]
```
