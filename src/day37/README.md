# SelectionSort
Implement SelectionSort to sort numbers of type double.

## Challenge
Write a program that generates arrays of sizes 10,000, 100,000, 10,000,000 (or whatever your computer can support), copies the array, and sorts them using SelectionSort and MergeSort. Time how long they take and record the results.

## Results
Results for sorting an array of 10,000 random doubles:  
MergeSort time = 4 milliseconds  
SelectionSort time = 60 milliseconds  

Results for sorting an array of 100,000 random doubles:  
MergeSort time = 25 milliseconds  
SelectionSort time = 3806 milliseconds (3.947 seconds)  

Results for sorting an array of 1,000,000 random doubles:  
MergeSort time =  242 milliseconds  
SelectionSort time = 371283 milliseconds (6.18805 minutes)

Results for sorting an array of 2,000,000 random doubles:  
MergeSort time =  473 milliseconds  
SelectionSort time = 1574088 milliseconds (26.2348 minutes)
