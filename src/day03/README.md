# Array Binary Search
Binary search in a sorted 1D array

## Challenge
Write a function which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Return the index of the array's element that is equal to the search key or -1 if the element doesn't exist.

Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

Example:
Input <- [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42], 15
Output <- 2

Input <- [11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77], 90
Output <- -1
